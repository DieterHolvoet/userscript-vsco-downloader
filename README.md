## Tampermonkey configuration
To make sure downloads work, a little setup has to be done first:
1. Go to the Tampermonkey settings page and make sure `Config mode` is set to `Advanced`
2. Scroll down to the `Downloads BETA` section of the page and change `Download Mode` to `Browser API`.
3. If asked for, grant Tampermonkey the necessary permissions.
4. Downloads should work now! If they don't, please create an issue.
